prudentGallery
==============


This is a gallery application for Prudence (http://threecrickets.com/prudence).

It simple shows images from folders as gallery using Shadowbox 3.0.3 (http://www.shadowbox-js.com/). You can find a demo at http://euve1500.vserver.de:9080/gallery

More information about prudentGallery can be found at http://blog.scrobble.me/tag/prudentGallery/

Installation:
=============

* Download and Install Prudence with Javascript flavor.
* Drop image-utils-XYZ.jar in Prudences "libraries" folder
* Extract prudentGallery into Prudences "application" folder (and rename it to your needs)

Configuration:
==============

Upload images:
--------------

* Create a folder "uploads" within the prudentGallery folder
* Upload your images to this folder (This folder can contain folders too)

Define image scaler:
--------------------

By default Java will be used for scaling the images, but this is not recommended. You can use any command line image scaler or ImageJ.

IrfanView (only Windows):
-------------------------
Instead of using the standard mechanism of resizing the preview, it is recommended to use IrfanView (http://www.irfanview.net/).

* Download and install IrfanView: http://www.irfanview.net/
* Make sure IrfanView is available via the PATH variable of Windows
* Edit the file "settings.js" within the applications folder:
** Uncomment the line: imageScaler = new Packages.me.scrobble.images.scalers.IrfanViewImageScaler()

ImageJ:
-------
This image scaler should be used, where only Java is available. This scaler can be quite
slow (first calls for a gallery might be slow), as it only scales one image at a time.

* Download the "Platform Independent" version of ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html)
* Extract the file "ij.jar" to Prudence "lbraries" folder
* Edit the file "settings.js" within the applications folder:
** Uncomment the line: imageScaler = new Packages.me.scrobble.images.scalers.ImageJImageScaler()

ImageMagick:
------------
Alternatively you can use ImageMagick via the CommandLineImageScaler

* Download and install ImageMagick (Make sure you add it to the path of your system)
* Uncomment the three lines after "// ImageMagick ..." within prudentGallery "settings.js"

License:
========

* You can freely use, edit and distribute this gallery.
